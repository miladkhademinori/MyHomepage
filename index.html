<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I am currently an M.Sc. student at Amirkabir University of Technology. My research interests are Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-ESNs), Convex Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<ul>
   <li> <b>Since 2016--</b> I am currently a self-motivated researcher at Amirkabir University of Technology with a GPA of 3.8/4. I enjoy studying papers especially mathematical formulation of problems and addressing them using optimization appraoches and learning paradigms such as Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Statistical Learning. </li>
   <li> <b>2012-2016--</b> I have graduated from Semnan University in 2016 (after 4 years) with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering (EE). I ranked 1st among B.Sc. graduate students (about 50) in EE with a GPA of 3.7/4. Thereafter, I decided to continue my study.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>Internet of Things, Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs), Convex Optimizationm, Wireless Networks, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<h2>Honors and Awards</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <b>2017--</b> I have been appreciated by Huawei and I have got HCNA certificate (Huawei Certified Network Associate). HCNA certification validates the knowledge and skills requred for basic configuration and maintenance of small to medium-sized networks <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nc569kmtihm016b/010100101401806859251429.pdf">(See the certificate)</a>.</li>
  <li> <b>2016--</b> I ranked 1st among B.Sc. graduate students (about 50 students) in EE at Semnan University. I also have been Top Mark in several courses. I have been selected to be a Teacher Assistant (TA) to teach student Electrical Circuits for 2 years.</li>
  <li> <b>2016--</b> I won the 1st prize in the nationwide Olympiad in EE at Semnan University. This nationwide Olympiad evaluates participant's skills in the fields of Electrical Circuits, Electronic Circuits, Electrical Machines, Linear Control Theory, and Electromagnetics. This victory was unprecedented in the history of the Semnan University.</li>
  <li> <b>2016--</b> I ranked 189th among 50000 competitors in the nationawide university entrance exam in EE, therefore I was able to get into the best 1% universities (Amirkabir University of Technology) in Iran. </li>
</ul>
